        <p>Moviescope is a personal movie journal, which helps users to track films they have watched or want to watch in the future. A user can search for a movie by title, add reviews and ratings, and store it in a personal journal. Also, Moviescope provides a list of recommendations matching the userâ€™s taste. A user can compile a wishlist of films and find watch options on streaming services and in theaters.</p>

        <p>Hackbright Academy is the leading <strong>software engineering school for women</strong> founded in San Francisco in 2012. Their accelerated software development program is stimulating, exciting and fulfilling.<br>
            The Software Engineering Program curriculum combines <strong>computer science data structures and algorithms</strong> with marketable industry standard web development technologies. Within 12 weeks we covered the most critical skills and tools required to be a software engineer, including <strong>version control</strong>, the Linux command line, <strong>relational databases, web frameworks, AJAX/JQuery</strong> and front-end frameworks. We also covered broader essential software engineering topics like <strong>debugging, pair programming</strong>, code reviews, core computer science concepts (including <strong>runtime analysis, recursion</strong>, and advanced data structures, such as <strong>linked lists, graphs and trees</strong>), and technical whiteboarding.<br>
            <strong>It was challenging and fun, and a piece of my heart will always stay with this emazing school</strong></p>
